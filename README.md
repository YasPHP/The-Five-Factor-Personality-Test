# About

The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a taxonomy, or grouping,
for personality traits. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words
used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious 
is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". This theory is based therefore on the association 
between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests
five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche. (wikipedia)
